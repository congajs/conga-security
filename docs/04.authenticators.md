# Authenticators

The authenticator's purpose is to create and authenticate security tokens.  The authenticator will 
use the provider to fetch an account resource and validate the security credentials attached to the 
request.  If the validation succeeds, the authenticator will return an auth token.

The authenticator needs to be registered as a service.  When you configure the authenticator, you 
provide a reference to the service definition, like so: `@my.authenticator.service`.

## Configuration

Authenticators need to be assigned to a firewall.  This can happen one of two ways.

Option 1, define the authenticator and reference it by ID.

Option 2, attach it to the firewall config directly.  This does not allow you to reuse the 
authenticator options for different firewalls.  You can reuse another authenticator id, but 
the options will not be merged.

The following are all valid ways to configure your authenticator.

##### By ID With Options

```yaml
security:
    firewall:
        my-realm:
            route: ^/my-realm
            provider: my-provider
            authenticator:
                id: http-basic
                options:
                    response_header: true
    
    authenticators:
        http-basic: '@security.firewall.authenticator.http_basic'
```

##### By Service With Options

```yaml
security:
    firewall:
        my-realm:
            route: ^/my-realm
            authenticator:
                service: '@security.firewall.authenticator.http_basic'
                options:
                    response_header: false
```

##### By ID

```yaml
security:
    firewall:
        my-realm:
            route: ^/my-realm
            authenticator: http-basic
    
    authenticators:
        http-basic: 
            service: '@security.firewall.authenticator.http_basic'
            options:
                response_header: false
```

# Conga Authenticators

> Some authenticators are packaged with Conga by default.

### HTTP Basic Authentication

The HTTP Basic authenticator is provided for you and looks for authentication in the request 
headers.  This requires the authentication to be sent on each request and usually is not used 
with a stateful firewall.

`Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)`

If the header is not provided, a 401 status response is returned along with a WWW-Authenticate 
response header.

##### Configuration Options

The following table lists configuration options for the HTTP Basic Authenticator:

Config | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`response_header` | Boolean | Defines whether or not to return a WWW-Authenticate header in the response if the Authorization header is not present.  Defaults to "true".
`scheme` | String | Defines the scheme to use in the Authorization header.  Defaults to "Basic".

```yaml
security:
    firewall:
        my-realm:
            route: ^/my-realm
            authenticator:
                service: '@security.firewall.authenticator.http_basic'
                options:
                    scheme: Basic
                    response_header: true 
```

### HTTP Form Authentication

The HTTP Form authenticator will let you send up an HTTP POST request to login to the restricted 
realm.  This is usually used with a stateful firewall where authentication credentials are stored 
in a session, and a cookie is exchanged on each request to maintain authentication.

> You should use this together with `@conga/framework-session`.

##### Configuration Options

Form based authentication is a little more tricky than HTTP Basic, in that it needs multiple 
views.  The form authenticator allows you configure all of the necessary views to make a clean 
user experience.

Config | Description
--- | ---
`view_route` | The route that shows the login form
`action_route` | The route that the form submits to.  This needs to be different than your view_route.
`action_failed_route` | The route that the user is redirected to on a failed login attempt
`success_redirect_route` | The route that the user should land on when successfully authenticated
`login_field` | The login / username field name in the form post data
`secret_field` | The secret / password field name in the form post data 

The following routes need a controller a view set up.  This is not done for you, so make sure you 
define routes for: `view_route`, `action_failed_route`, `success_redirect_route`.  

The `action_route` is routed and handled for you.

```yaml
security:
    firewall:
        my-realm:
            route: ^/my-realm
            authenticator:
                service: '@security.firewall.authenticator.http_form'
                options:
                    view_route: /my-realm/login 
                    action_route: /my-realm/_login 
                    action_failed_route: /my-realm/login/fail 
                    success_redirect_route: /my-realm 
                    login_field: email 
                    secret_field: password 
```

The following template is an example that you might return when the user navigates to 
`/my-realm/login`.

```html
<form action="/my-realm/_login" method="POST">
    <div>
        <label>
            Email:
            <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" /> 
        </label>
    </div>
    <div>
        <label>
            Password:
            <input type="password" name="password" />
        </label>
    </div>
    <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

### Custom Authentication

> You can make your own authenticator.

Custom authenticators just need to inherit from 
`@conga/framework-security:security/authenticator/AbstractAuthenticator`.  The AbstractAuthenticator 
takes care of most tasks for you, and you are only required to implement `createToken`, but you 
can overload any method you like, using inheritance.

##### my-bundle:security/MyAuthenticator
```
const { AbstractAuthenticator } = require('@conga/framework-security').Authenticator;
const { PreAuthToken, AuthTokenCredentials } = require('@conga/framework-security').Token;
 
class MyAuthenticator extends AbstractAuthenticator {
    /**
     * Create an authentication token for the current request
     * @param {Object} request The conga request object
     * @param {String} [realm] The realm the token belongs to
     * @returns {Promise}
     */
    createToken(request, realm = 'some-default-security-realm-name') {
        
        // your task is to get the username and password from the request payload / headers
        // and then return a promise with a PreAuthToken having those credentials intact
        
        // if you are expecting a JSON request body, for instance, you could do the following
        
        let username = request.body.username;
        let password = request.body.password;
        
        return Promise.resolve(
            new PreAuthToken(new AuthTokenCredentials(username, password), realm)
        );
    }
}
 
module.exports = MyAuthenticator;
```

##### services.yml
```

    my.authenticator.service:
        constructor: "my-bundle:security/MyAuthenticator
