# Authenticators

The authenticator's purpose is to create and authenticate security tokens.  The authenticator will 
use the provider to fetch an account resource and validate the security credentials attached to the 
request.  If the validation succeeds, the authenticator will return an auth token.

The authenticator needs to be registered as a service.  When you configure the authenticator, you 
provide a reference to the service definition, like so: `@my.authenticator.service`.

Currently, the only built-in supported authenticator is the HTTP Basic Auth authenticator.  This is 
registered as `@security.firewall.authenticator.http_basic`.

You can make your own authenticators, they just need to inherit from 
`@conga/framework-security:security/authenticator/AbstractAuthenticator`.  The AbstractAuthenticator 
takes care of most tasks for you, and you are only required to implement `createToken`, but you 
can overload any method you like, using inheritance.

##### my-bundle:security/MyAuthenticator
```
const { AbstractAuthenticator } = require('@conga/framework-security').Authenticator;
const { PreAuthToken, AuthTokenCredentials } = require('@conga/framework-security').Token;
 
class MyAuthenticator extends AbstractAuthenticator {
    /**
     * Create an authentication token for the current request
     * @param {Object} request The conga request object
     * @param {String} [realm] The realm the token belongs to
     * @returns {Promise}
     */
    createToken(request, realm = 'some-default-security-realm-name') {
        
        // your task is to get the username and password from the request payload / headers
        // and then return a promise with a PreAuthToken having those credentials intact
        
        // if you are expecting a JSON request body, for instance, you could do the following
        
        let username = request.body.username;
        let password = request.body.password;
        
        return Promise.resolve(
            new PreAuthToken(new AuthTokenCredentials(username, password), realm)
        );
    }
}
 
module.exports = MyAuthenticator;
```
